# Exa Vercel AI SDK Provider - Review Summary

## Review Date
October 10, 2025

## Status
✅ **PROJECT VERIFIED AND PRODUCTION-READY**

---

## What Was Reviewed

I conducted a comprehensive review of your Exa Vercel AI SDK provider to ensure full compatibility with:
1. **Vercel AI SDK Language Model Specification V2**
2. **Exa Answer API endpoint documentation**
3. **Best practices for custom provider development**

---

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. ✅ Custom Fetch Support in Streaming
**Issue**: The `doStream()` method was using the global `fetch` instead of respecting the custom fetch configuration.

**Fix**: Updated to use `this.config.fetch || fetch` for proper custom fetch support.

**Location**: `src/exa-answer-language-model.ts:220`

### 2. ✅ Response Metadata in Streaming
**Issue**: Missing `response-metadata` stream event which is part of the V2 specification.

**Fix**: Added `response-metadata` event emission with `modelId` in the streaming transformer.

**Location**: `src/exa-answer-language-model.ts:303-309`

### 3. ✅ Error Handling Enhancement
**Issue**: Generic error messages without proper AI SDK error types.

**Fix**: 
- Imported `APICallError` and `InvalidResponseDataError` from `@ai-sdk/provider`
- Updated error handling in `doStream()` to use proper error types with detailed information
- Improved error messages to include status codes and response bodies

**Location**: `src/exa-answer-language-model.ts:1-10, 230-246`
